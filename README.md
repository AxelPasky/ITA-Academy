## Repository Structure
- [`Sprint-1/`](https://github.com/AxelPasky/ITA-Academy/tree/main/Sprint-1) — Materials and exercises for Sprint 1.
- [`Sprint-2/`](https://github.com/AxelPasky/ITA-Academy/tree/main/Sprint-2) — Materials and exercises for Sprint 2.
- [`Sprint-3/`](https://github.com/AxelPasky/ITA-Academy/tree/main/Sprint-3) — Materials and exercises for Sprint 3.
- `README.md` — This file.

## How Sprints Are Organized
Each Sprint folder contains:
- exercises and/or projects completed during the Sprint;
- any supporting resources (notes, snippets, examples);
- sometimes a Sprint-specific README with local instructions, if present.

Tip: if a Sprint contains multiple exercises or projects, create dedicated subfolders and (if helpful) a README for each with:
- exercise goal/brief,
- technologies used,
- run instructions,
- notes or further reading.

## Sprint Index

## How to Run/Try the Exercises
Approach varies by exercise. General guidelines:
- Static HTML/CSS/JS: open the `.html` file in a modern browser.
- PHP:
  - If the exercise doesn’t require a dedicated web server, you can use PHP’s built‑in server from the project folder:
    ```
    php -S localhost:8000
    ```
    then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.
  - If there’s a structure with `public/` (or similar), start the server pointing to that directory:
    ```
    php -S localhost:8000 -t public
    ```
- Additional dependencies/tools (Composer, Node, etc.): follow the specific instructions in the Sprint or project README, if present.

## Requirements
- PHP installed (version compatible with the exercises).
- An up‑to‑date browser.
- [Optional] Composer or Node.js if required by specific exercises/projects.

## Contributing
- Each new exercise/project should include:
  - a short description,
  - run instructions,
  - any prerequisites.
- Keep a consistent structure across Sprints to make navigation easier.
