### 2.2_MySQL

📌 **Description**  
This repository contains database modeling exercises focused on the creation of relational tables and EER diagrams using MySQL. The exercises simulate real-life scenarios where databases are designed from scratch based on detailed specifications.

The two main exercises covered are:

- **Exercise 1 – Optician “Cul d'Ampolla”**  
  Design of a database for an optician store, including the management of customers, glasses, suppliers, and sales.

- **Exercise 2 – Pizzeria Online Ordering System**  
  Design of a web-based food delivery system, modeling customers, orders, products (pizzas, burgers, drinks), stores, employees, and delivery logistics.

💻 **Technologies Used**  
* MySQL  
* SQL Workbench (EER Diagrams & Table Design)  
* BeeKeeper Studio  
* Visual Studio  
* XAMPP (Apache & MySQL server)

📋 **Requirements**  
* MySQL Server installed and running (locally or via XAMPP).  
* SQL client to manage and test queries (e.g., MySQL Workbench, BeeKeeper Studio).  
* Visual Studio (optional, used during project development).  
* Diagrams created using SQL Workbench EER functionality.  

🛠️ **Installation**  
1. Make sure your MySQL server is running (via XAMPP or standalone).  
2. Open the `.sql` scripts provided for each exercise using your preferred SQL client.  
3. Import and execute the scripts to create the necessary tables and relationships.  
4. Optionally, open the `.mwb` (MySQL Workbench) file to explore or modify the EER diagrams.  

▶️ **Execution**  
1. Use your SQL client (e.g., BeeKeeper Studio, Workbench) to connect to your MySQL server.  
2. Run the SQL scripts corresponding to each exercise.  
3. Review the EER diagram in SQL Workbench to understand the structure and relationships between entities.  
4. Test queries and verify data integrity where applicable.
