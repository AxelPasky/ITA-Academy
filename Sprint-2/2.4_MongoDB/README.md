# MongoDB - Database Query Exercises

📌 **Description**  
This repository contains MongoDB query exercises focused on exploring and retrieving data from a real-world dataset. The queries simulate typical operations used in database exploration, filtering, and sorting.

The main exercise covered is:

- **Query Practice – Restaurants Collection**

🛠️ **Installation**  
1. Ensure your MongoDB instance is running (locally or via cloud service).  
2. Import the `restaurants.json` dataset into your MongoDB database.  
3. Use MongoDB Compass or the shell to view and query the data.

▶️ **Execution**
